DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) is the foundation of programming that helps you store data efficiently and solve problems in an optimized way.
###
A data structure is a way to organize and store data so it can be used efficiently.

Examples:

Array – stores elements in a sequence

Linked List – elements connected using pointers

Stack – follows LIFO (Last In First Out)

Queue – follows FIFO (First In First Out)

Tree – hierarchical structure

Graph – network of connected nodes

Hash Table – key-value storage
###

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.

Examples:

Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)

Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)

Recursion

Dynamic Programming

Greedy algorithms
